					<h4> Why knowing about response times is important?</h4>
					<p>The introduction of technology aimed at reducing the response times of emergency medical services has been one of the principal innovations in crisis care over the last several decades. These substantial investments have typically been justified by an assumed link between shorter response times and improved health outcomes. However, current medical research does not generally show a relationship between response time and mortality. In this study, we explain the discrepancy between conventional wisdom and mortality; existing medical research fails to account for the endogeneity of incident severity and response times. Analyzing detailed call-level information from the state of Utah's Bureau of Emergency Medical Services, we measure the impact of response time on mortality and hospital utilization using the distance of the incident from the nearest EMS agency headquarters as an instrument for response time. This is why response time is so important for the general population's health.  We find that response times significantly affect mortality and the likelihood of being admitted to the hospital, but not procedures or utilization within the hospital.</p>
					<h4>The dangerous of falling</h4>
					<p>Falling is something we don't usually imagine to be serious. As young adults, once we fall, both figuratively and literally, we spring right back up again. However, this isn't the case for senior citizens. Annually, falls are reported by one-third of all people over the age of 65. Two-thirds of those who fall will do so again within six months. Falls are the leading cause of death from injury among people 65 and older. Approximately 9,500 deaths in older Americans are associated with falls each year.</p>
					<h4>What to do if someone falls</h4>
					<p>1. Stay calm and help the them remain calm by prompting them to take slow and deep breaths</p>
					<p>2. Examine them for injuries such as bleeding, bruises, sprains, and broken bones.</p>
					<p>3. Ask them if they are in pain, and if they can locate it.</p>
					<p>4. If they are seriously injured, comfort them, and call 911. Don't let them move.</p>
					<p>5. If they aren’t badly hurt and they want to get up, proceed slowly. Stop at any point if they become stuck, experience pain or become too tired to get all the way up.</p>
					<p>6. Find two sturdy chairs. Place one next to the senior’s head and the other down by their feet. Keep in mind that your loved one must be capable of doing the physical work required to get up. Your role is to help guide them through these steps and keep them steady, not lift their weight. If they cannot do this, then call to request a lift assist.</p>
					<p>7. Help your loved one roll over onto their side and assist them in getting onto their hands and knees. If they suffer from sore knees, place a towel beneath them to make this step more comfortable.</p>
					<p>8. Move the chair closest to their head directly in front of where they are so they can rise up to place their hands evenly on the seat and assume a kneeling position.</p>
					<p>9. Ask the senior to lean forward on the seat as they bring their strongest leg forward, leading with the knee to place their foot flat on the floor. The senior should look like they are in a kneeling lunge at the end of this step.</p>
					<p>10. Move the second chair directly behind your loved one, then ask them to use both their arms and legs to push themselves up and sit back into this chair. You can use your hands to keep your loved one steady, but keep your back upright and make sure they are doing the physical work to lift themselves.</p>
					<p>11. Keep the senior seated until you’re confident they can stand and continue moving around without hurting themselves or falling again.</p>
					<p>12. Immediately notify their doctor that they’ve had a fall and keep an eye out for emerging pain and signs of injury.</p>
